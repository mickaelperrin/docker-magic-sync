Magic sync for docker
=====================

### Note: Je n'utilise plus ce projet et lui ait préféré l'excellent Mutagen https://mutagen.io et mutagen-compose notamment

## Description

Magic sync for docker is a simple tool that watches local directory trees and syncs in real time the modification in a
container.

This image provides:
 - real time bi-directionnal syncing between your host and a container
 - full performance for your docker mounts (OSXFS, NFS, Vboxfs... are really slow especially for large code base)
 - simple configuration
 - docker only as a requirement

## Prerequesties

The mounted folders in the container must be abled to emit `inotify` events, currently this was tested only with OSXFS
(Docker for Mac).

## How to use

### Provided example

A full example is provided in the [example folder](https://github.com/mickaelperrin/docker-magic-sync/tree/master/example), it runs `composer install` of a Drupal project (large code base). To run it:

    cd example
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up

Then, spawn in a new shell:

    docker exec -it example_php_1 bash -c 'composer --working-dir=/src/example/src install'

### Generic example

Here is an example on how to use it with a docker-compose file. The scenario illustrates a way to sync source code in real-time from the host inside
the container and get the output generated by the execution of the code back to the host.

The `app` container inits the volume `/src` where the code will reside.
The `magic-sync` container maps the local folder `./src` to the folder `/src.magic` with native mounts (osxfs)

    version: '2'

    services:
      app:
        image: alpine:latest
        command: /bin/true
        volumes:
        - /src
      php:
        build: ./fpm
        volumes_from:
        - app
      magic-sync:
        image: mickaelperrin/docker-magic-sync:latest
        environment:
        - SYNC_USER=www-data
        - SYNC_UID=33
        - SYNC_IGNORE_NAMES=.idea:.git
        - SYNC_IGNORE_PATHS=www/example:www2/example2
        #- MAXIMUM_INOTIFY_WATCHES=524288
        volumes:
        # Configure here the mappings between your host and the container.
        # Simply add a `.magic` extension to the volume path in the container.
        # the :cached is optional, but we hope it improves inotify events.
        - ./src:/src.magic:cached
        # this is needed for automatic discovery of mounted volumes in this container.
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
        # If you want to configure USER / UID / IGNORE by volumes, you can use a simple YAML configuration file
        # - ./docker-syncs.yml:/sync-entrypoint.d/docker-syncs.yml
        volumes_from:
        - app
        # Privilegied mode is needed if you want to increase the maximum inotify watches for very large synced folders
        # by setting the ENV var MAXIMUM_INOTIFY_WATCHES.
        #privileged: true
        
### Start / stop sync process

To prevent crash of inotify events, you can stop the container before running an heavy files generation process (for example: a composer install commande).

```
docker exec -it project_magic-sync-1 bash -c 'supervisorctl stop unison--src'
docker exec -it project_magic-sync-1 bash -c 'supervisorctl start unison--src'
```

## Folders to sync

The mapping between the volumes to sync is done *magically* by looking for volumes mounted in the container that ends
with a `.magic` extension. They will be synced with a folder of the same name **without** the `.magic` extension.

### Configuration

Configuration is done through environment variables **and/or** YAML config file(s).
Configuration set in environment variables is used globally for all synced folders, except a specific value is defined
in a YAML config file. All yaml files provided in the `/sync-entrypoint.d` will be parsed as configuration files.

### User mapping

You can configure the user mapping by providing the user name **and** the uid of the user, through the ENV variables
`SYNC_USER` and `SYNC_UID`, or the `user` and `uid` entries in the YAML file.

### Ignore

You can configure the files / folders to ignore by providing the `-ignore` options that need to be passed to unison.
See the official documentation of unison on how to configure excludes.

### Advanced options

If you need to sync *very* large code base, you can run out of `inotify_watchers`, you can increase this amount by
providing the number you want in the ENV variable `MAXIMUM_INOTIFY_WATCHES`. Be aware that you need to set the `privileged`
option for the container in this case.

## Behind the scenes

This container uses:
 - `unison` for bi-directionnal syncing **and** file watching
 - `docker-gen` for volumes discovery

### Special thanks

Special thanks for [Eugen Mayer](https://github.com/EugenMayer) which makes me think about this implementation with OSXFS.

## WARNING
An issue with OSXFS prevents `inotify events` to get triggered in a mounted volume if the number of files created is high. This occurs when you perform a project initialisation like a `composer install` on a fresh project. Be sure, to stop the sync process before doing so, then re-eanble it to grab the generated files.  

### How to see the inotify bug

1. Run `docker exec -it magicsync_magic-sync_1 bash -c 'inotifywatch /src.magic/example/src/.gitignore'`
2. Edit on the host the .gitignore file in example/src
3. Kill the inotifywatch process. You got "No events occured"
4. Run `docker exec -it magicsync_magic-sync_1 bash -c 'inotifywatch /src.magic/example/src/.gitignore'`
5. Run `docker exec -it magicsync_magic-sync_1 bash -c 'echo "##test" >> /src.magic/example/src/.gitignore'`
6. Kill the inotifywatch process. You got "9      2       1       1            2              3     /src.magic/example/src/.gitignore"
